> "The unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates

I've been thinking about this sentence for years now, and I'm still not sure I understand it.

## What Does It Mean to Examine?

On the surface, self-examination seems straightforward. It means asking yourself hard questions: What do I actually value? Why do I believe what I believe? Am I living in a way that aligns with my principles?

But Socrates wasn't just talking about occasional introspection. He was talking about a *practice*—a relentless questioning of everything, including (especially) the things everyone around you takes for granted.

This is exhausting. It's also deeply uncomfortable. Most of us don't want to examine our lives too closely because we're afraid of what we'll find. We build comfortable narratives about who we are and why we do what we do. Examination threatens those narratives.

## The Cost of Comfort

Here's what worries me: it's easy to mistake comfort for wisdom. If I'm not occasionally unsettled by my own beliefs, I'm probably not examining them closely enough.

The examined life is not a comfortable life. But it might be a more *honest* one.

## Is It Worth It?

Socrates thought the examined life was so important that he was willing to die for it. He could have recanted, saved himself, and continued teaching. But he believed that living without questioning—that is, living without philosophy—wasn't really living at all.

I don't know if I agree. I suspect there's value in some amount of comfortable unexamined living. You can't question everything all the time; you'd never get anything done. 

But I also suspect most of us don't examine enough. We go along with our culture, our families, our expectations, without ever asking whether they make sense for us.

Maybe the goal isn't perfect examination. Maybe it's just *more* examination. A little more questioning. A little more willingness to be uncomfortable.

Maybe that's enough.
