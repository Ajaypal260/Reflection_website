Faith is one of those words that means everything and nothing depending on who you ask. To some, it's the foundation of certainty. To others, it's a synonym for gullibility. But I think both sides miss something important.

## Faith as Trust

When I think about faith, I find it most useful to distinguish between faith *in* something and faith *that* something is true. 

Faith as trust—faith *in*—is a relational concept. It's what you have when you trust another person, when you've built up a history that gives you confidence they'll act in certain ways. This kind of faith makes sense. We trust our friends, our families, even our doctors and mechanics. We don't have perfect information about their competence or intentions, but we have enough experience to act with reasonable confidence.

Religious faith often operates this way too. The faithful trust in God not because they've proven God's existence, but because they've experienced something that builds that trust over time. It's not blind—it's relational.

## Faith as Belief

The trickier version is faith *that*—believing specific propositions are true without sufficient evidence. This is where most of the controversy lives.

I've struggled with this. On one hand, I think believing things without evidence is dangerous. It's how we get conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and all the worst parts of human cognition. On the other hand, we believe plenty of things without conclusive proof all the time. Most of science itself operates on faith that the universe is comprehensible and that our observations aren't fundamentally misleading us.

## The Middle Path

Maybe the answer isn't to abandon faith or to accept it uncritically. Maybe it's to be honest about what we're doing when we choose to believe something.

When I read religious texts, when I sit with difficult questions, I'm not looking for certainty. I'm looking for something more like *orientation*—a sense of which direction points toward a meaningful life, which practices build community, which values are worth sacrificing for.

Faith, then, isn't a conclusion. It's a practice. It's what you do when you act as if something matters, even when you can't prove it does.

I'm still thinking through this. But I suspect the answer isn't to resolve the tension between faith and reason, but to hold both of them together—each one keeping the other honest.
